- Templates created for:
  - Welcome messages

**Example Flow:**

  - Detect a **missed call**.
  - Automatically send an **SMS that acknowledges the call**:
    - “Hey! Sorry we missed your call. How can we help you today?”
  - Capture their answer as a **lead**, which can be followed up manually or through automations.

**Impact:**

- Fewer leads lost due to missed calls.
- Customer feels heard even without an immediate pick-up.

## 📈 Systems & Sales Infrastructure Built

Beyond the technical services, DeZerraDigital has also built a **repeatable system** for selling and explaining these services.

### Sales & Outreach Assets

What’s already created:

- **Website previews & mockups** to show clients what their new site could look like.
- **Sales slide decks / presentations** explaining:

- One-time website build fee.  
- Monthly maintenance plans such as:
  - **Basic (~$57/month):**
    - Site updates
    - Basic monitoring
    - Minor content edits
  - **Premium (~$227/month and up):**
    - Everything in Basic
    - Automation monitoring & tweaks
    - Chat bot improvements
    - Funnel testing & adjustments

*(These exact numbers can be adjusted per client. The idea is a combination of one-time build + recurring automation & support.)*

## 🧱 Tech & Implementation (High-Level)

To stay flexible for different clients, DeZerraDigital uses a **tool-agnostic** approach:

- **Websites**
  - Modern site builders and/or custom **HTML/CSS/JS**.
  - Responsive design on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **Automations**
  - API-based integrations (email, SMS, forms, schedulers).
  - Logic-based workflows for triggers (form submitted, call missed, etc.).
- **Security & Reliability**
  - Cybersecurity-oriented mindset from the founder’s background.
  - Focus on minimizing attack surface, using reputable platforms, and following best practices where applicable.

*(This README intentionally stays tech-agnostic so it doesn’t lock in one specific provider—Twilio, Zapier, Make, etc. can be swapped based on client needs.)*
